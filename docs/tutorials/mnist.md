In this tutorial, we will work through examples of training a simple multi-layer perceptron and then a convolutional neural network (the LeNet architecture) on the [MNIST handwritten digit dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The code for this tutorial could be found in [`Pkg.dir("MXNet")`/examples/mnist/](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl/tree/master/examples/mnist).

# Simple 3-layer MLP

This is a tiny 3-layer MLP that could be easily trained on CPU. The script starts with
```julia
using MXNet
```
to load the `MXNet` module. Then we are ready to define the network architecture via the [symbolic API](../user-guide/overview.md#symbols-and-composition). We start with a placeholder `data` symbol,
```julia
data = mx.Variable(:data)
```
and then cascading fully-connected layers and activation functions:
```julia
fc1  = mx.FullyConnected(data = data, name=:fc1, num_hidden=128)
act1 = mx.Activation(data = fc1, name=:relu1, act_type=:relu)
fc2  = mx.FullyConnected(data = act1, name=:fc2, num_hidden=64)
act2 = mx.Activation(data = fc2, name=:relu2, act_type=:relu)
fc3  = mx.FullyConnected(data = act2, name=:fc3, num_hidden=10)
```
Note each composition we take the previous symbol as the `data` argument, forming a feedforward chain. The architecture looks like
```
Input --> 128 units (ReLU) --> 64 units (ReLU) --> 10 units
```
where the last 10 units correspond to the 10 output classes (digits 0,...,9). We then add a final `Softmax` operation to turn the 10-dimensional prediction to proper probability values for the 10 classes:
```julia
mlp  = mx.Softmax(data = fc3, name=:softmax)
```
As we can see, the MLP is just a chain of layers. For this case, we can also use the `mx.chain` macro. The same architecture above can be defined as
```julia
mlp = @mx.chain mx.Variable(:data)             =>
  mx.FullyConnected(name=:fc1, num_hidden=128) =>
  mx.Activation(name=:relu1, act_type=:relu)   =>
  mx.FullyConnected(name=:fc2, num_hidden=64)  =>
  mx.Activation(name=:relu2, act_type=:relu)   =>
  mx.FullyConnected(name=:fc3, num_hidden=10)  =>
  mx.Softmax(name=:softmax)
```

After defining the architecture, we are ready to load the MNIST data. MXNet.jl provide built-in data providers for the MNIST dataset, which could automatically download the dataset into `Pkg.dir("MXNet")/data/mnist` if necessary. We wrap the code to construct the data provider into `mnist-data.jl` so that it could be shared by both the MLP example and the LeNet ConvNets example.
```julia
batch_size = 100
include("mnist-data.jl")
train_provider, eval_provider = get_mnist_providers(batch_size)
```
If you need to write your own data providers for customized data format, please refer to **TODO**: pointer to data provider API.

Given the architecture and data, we can instantiate an *estimator* to do the actual training. `mx.FeedForward` is the built-in estimator that is suitable for most feed-forward architectures. When constructing the estimator, we also specify the *context* on which the computation should be carried out. Because this is a really tiny MLP, we will just run on a single CPU device.
```julia
estimator = mx.FeedForward(mlp, context=mx.cpu())
```
You can use a `mx.gpu()` or if a list of devices (e.g. `[mx.gpu(0), mx.gpu(1)]`) is provided, data-parallelization will be used automatically. But for this tiny example, using a GPU device might not help.

The last thing we need to specify is the optimization algorithm (a.k.a. *optimizer*) to use. We use the basic SGD with a fixed learning rate 0.1 and momentum 0.9:
```julia
optimizer = mx.SGD(lr=0.1, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=0.00001)
```
Now we can do the training. Here the `epoch_stop` parameter specifies that we want to train for 20 epochs. We also supply a `eval_data` to monitor validation accuracy on the validation set.
```julia
mx.fit(estimator, optimizer, train_provider, epoch_stop=20, eval_data=eval_provider)
```
Here is a sample output
