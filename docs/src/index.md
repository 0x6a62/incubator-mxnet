# MXNet Documentation

[`MXNet.jl`](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl>) is the
[`Julia`](http://julialang.org/) package of
[`dmlc/mxnet`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet). `MXNet.jl` brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to Julia. Some highlight of features
include:

* Efficient tensor/matrix computation across multiple devices, including multiple CPUs, GPUs and distributed server nodes.
* Flexible symbolic manipulation to composite and construct state-of-the-art deep learning models.

For more details, see documentation below. Please also checkout the
[examples](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl/tree/master/examples) directory.
